# Airline Scheduling Routing
We discuss and handle the problem of routing and scheduling airplanes to maximize profit of the company and customer satisfaction. Problem at its core is given 
graph of connected cities, the demand across various cities, fleet of aircrafts available to a particular airline and distance across these cities. We model this problem as an optimization case study and discuss the results observed over a specific demand. Further moving we would work on robust optimization by using an adverserial element to amplify the robustness of the results observed.
