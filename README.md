# Airline Scheduling Routing
We discuss and handle the problem of routing and scheduling airplanes to maximize the profit of an airline company as well as customer satisfaction. The problem at its core is as follows: Given a graph of connected cities, the demand across various cities, number of aircrafts available to a particular airline and distance across these cities, we find out the routes the planes should follow and what time they should be dispatched at, in order to achieve our objective. We model this problem as an optimization case study and discuss the results observed over a specific demand. Further work would be on robust optimization by using an adverserial element to amplify the robustness of the results observed.

# Real Time Flight Handling
Real-time flight handling is a highly complex problem, chiefly due to the various uncertainties that enter the picture. Chief among these is unpredictable changes in weather conditions, which have a significant impact on the route any aircraft takes. Our model has been made robust by accounting for this uncertainty, and producing an updated route, without many radical changes, as and when newer data for weather conditions is obtained. Further, by incorporating the flow of time into the model, we have eliminated the possibility of collisions entirely. A GUI has been designed in order to aid visualization of output routes.
